											Project Plan
1.	Team
	●	We are a three members team all having informatics majors.
	●	Peiran Zhao: 
		-	I am currently a senior with an informatics major and a game design minor. I have a great interest in big data and deep learning, I think it is going to be a field with great potential and lots of opportunities.
	●	Sunny Xu:
		-	I am a senior majoring in Informatics and having a cognate which is Computer Art. I have three dogs, they are all Pomeranian. I usually like to walk the dog, listen to music, and play computer games. 
	●	Kris Zhang: 
		-	I am a senior student who is majoring in Informatics with a cognate of game design. My hobbies are playing video games and having fun with my friends when I have free time. I believe that technology can change the lifestyle of people and society, that’s why I think this class is important.

2.	Topic
	●	Gesture recognition and machine learning.
	●	Machine learning and especially deep learning has been really hot these years. With the help of technology, our lives are more and convenient and much easier than before. In this way, machine learning and deep learning has been a really hot topic and is undoubtedly our future. Gesture Recognition is also very trendy and has been working on for many years. However, it is not even close to its peak. And because gesture recognition is so useful in all fields, we are thinking about doing projects on this topic. We are going to cover some major features of gesture recognition as our research goes on. In this way, we are going to do lots of research on this area and use the dataset we get from online resources to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of gesture recognition. 

3.	Dataset
	●	We are planning to search and collect some datasets on the website.
	●	Our current dataset is directly coming from IBM Research and it is a really trustworthy dataset website. We are planning on using this dataset for our gesture recognition project. However, it is possible that we might change our mind as our project goes through. In that case, if the dataset we plan on using right is not working the best with our project, we will find some other related dataset later.  

4.	What needs to be done to get a great grade
	●	We need to unite and cooperate friendly.
	●	We set up a chatting room for us to chat with each other, therefore if there is any problem that one of us wants to discuss with, we get the chat room to communicate with the team.
	●	We set up a google drive folder that is shared with the whole team. In this way, we can do the work together and check each other’s works.
	●	If a team member has any questions or comments on the team or project, he or she should say that out honestly.
	●	All team members should do some research and share it with everyone.
	●	We need to set up a specific meeting time every week in order for all the people in our group to not fall behind. 
	●	We need to check the rubric as we move on and make sure that we meet all the requirements for the project. 
	●	Go to office hours for the class and check with the AI and professor about our project details to ensure that everything is running smoothly. 
	●	We can check other team members’ works and correct them if any of us find out the problem with it. In this way, we can also know what we get wrong and how we can make it better.
	●	We will need to practice the ability to use Github and open resources programs since we don’t have much past experience of it.
	●	We will follow directions on the rubric about writing project reports with the IEEE format, this is something we haven’t tried before, but we will try our best to make sure we are doing it correctly. 
	●	Processing data is also a sort of new field for all of us, but we are going to do lots of research, and watching some tutorials online to get the result we want.
