The topic I chose regarding artificial intelligence in Health and Medicine is artificial intelligence medical devices. In recent years, with the advancement of science and technology, there have been many successful cases of artificial intelligence in the medical and health field. More and more hospitals have also begun testing and using artificial intelligence medical devices. The popularity of artificial intelligence has also greatly facilitated and improved human life. Even though artificial intelligence brings great convenience to people's lives, many people are still struggling with the question of whether such artificial intelligence brings people good or bad.


The benefits of artificial intelligence medical devices:
- Drug development
   - The development of drugs has always been a big problem for scientists. Many times the success rate is too low, causing people to spend a lot of money but get nothing. Artificial intelligence has played a great role in this regard. It can quickly discover the effects of drugs and accurately predict the safety and side effects of drugs. In this way, artificial intelligence has made great progress in drug research for many diseases that have not been breakthroughs.
- Diagnosis of disease
   - In diagnosing disease conditions, humans have been transmitting various disease conditions and data to artificial intelligence, which also makes a large amount of information in the artificial intelligence database. Usually, doctors make their own judgments by understanding the condition, but sometimes there are cases of wrong judgments. At this time, artificial intelligence will be more accurate and precise in the diagnosis of the disease than human beings. Artificial intelligence has been instilled with data on various conditions and changes in the human body when it is being developed so that they can analyze the conditions through machine learning and make their judgments more accurate than normal people.
- Adjuvant therapy process
   - Artificial intelligence technology is also used to assist clinical doctors and nurses. In many cases, they can effectively help doctors to determine and formulate appropriate treatment plans and drug use. For the adjuvant therapy process, the best example is the application of IBM Watson in tumor research. Watson provided decision-making after learning many studies in the oncology treatment plan. Although it was not perfect yet, it was very useful for the medical team studying at the time.
- Arrange health management
   - Artificial intelligence can form health management that is most suitable for the user through the data from the user's mobile phone. At the same time, through the current advanced technology, many smartphones already have a certain judgment on the heartbeat and the length of time they look at the phone and the user's physical habits. In this way, artificial intelligence can give users a healthy diet plan through the judgment of data.
- Internet medical consultation
   - In recent years, the place where artificial intelligence has been used most is the intelligent answering system to users on various websites. In many cases, it is not an easy task for people to contact their family doctor or a nearby hospital when they want. In this case, if there is something unexpected, people don't know how to deal with it. At this time, artificial intelligence also reflects its convenience and usefulness. They can use some keywords in people's questions to judge the knowledge points people want to know in order to answer people's questions.
- Biomedical Research
   - For medical research, artificial intelligence has also contributed a lot of important knowledge points. The artificial intelligence system can tell scientists important points and establish many hypotheses by reading various research articles. At the same time, scientists can also use artificial intelligence to test the possibilities of various hypotheses. In this way, the research of scientists will become much more convenient.


The disadvantages of artificial intelligence medical devices:
- Although artificial intelligence brings various conveniences to human beings, it still has some potential and needs to be improved. For example, some artificial intelligence ventilators, so far, artificial intelligence ventilators cannot fully sense people's breathing. Therefore, there will be a situation that when the person has regained the ability to breathe, the ventilator does not accurately sense it, and thus continues to provide breathing to the patient. Such a situation may be fatal. There are also some artificial intelligence. When they absorb information and data, there will be some studies that have not been 100% confirmed, and they may be absorbed by artificial intelligence. Such misinformation may also lead to artificial intelligence's misjudgment of the condition, leading to the misdiagnosis of the patient.


In general, artificial intelligence medical devices have both good and bad aspects. In the future, if artificial intelligence will be better improved and improved, its impact on medicine will become greater and greater. In this way, people will be better diagnosed and treated. When using artificial intelligence, it can also reduce people's medical expenses, so that people can be treated.
