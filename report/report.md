## Abstract

Since our technology is more and more advanced as time goes by, traditional human-computer interaction has become increasingly difficult to meet people's demands. In this digital era, people need faster and more efficient methods to obtain information and data. Traditional and single input and output devices are not fast and convenient enough, it also requires users to learn their own methods of use, which is extremely inefficient and completely a waste of time. Therefore, artificial intelligence comes out, and its rise has followed the changeover times, and it satisfied people's needs. At the same time, gesture is one of the most important way for human to deliver information. It is simple, efficient, convenient, and universally acceptable. Therefore, gesture recognition has become an emerging field in intelligent human-computer interaction field, with great potential and future.

## 1. Introduction

As of today, since technology is improving so fast, there are many things that can be related to AI and machine learning. Hand gestures will be one of the most important ways to understand people. As we often notice, when people are doing speech, they often use hand gestures to collaborate with their words. And studying hand gestures will often reveal what the people who are giving the speech are thinking about. For example, when someone is lying, they tend to touch their nose with their hand, etc. So studying hand gestures will not only help people understand much more about human beings and it can also help our technology grow. For example, in AI and machine learning. Studying hand gestures will make or improve AI and machine learning to better understand humans and be more human-like.

## 2. Background

Nowadays, people are doing more and more research on high-tech, which also makes various high-tech products appear in the society. For people, electricity is as important as water and air. It is impossible to imagine a life without electricity. We can realize that technology is changing everything about people from various aspects. People living in this high-tech era are also forced to learn and understand the usage of various high-tech products. As a representative of high technology, artificial intelligence has also attracted a lot of attention in society. Because of the emergence of artificial intelligence, people have also begun to realize that preserving the characteristics of the people is also a very important point in high technology. Therefore, scientists thought of gestures, one of the most commonly used body language.[^1]


## 3. Gesture recognition

Gesture recognition is mainly divided into two categories, one is based on external device recognition, the specific application is data gloves, wearing it on user's hand, to obtain and analysis information through sensors. This method has obvious shortcomings, though it is accurate and has excellent response speed, but it is costly and is not good for large-scale promotion. The other one is the use of computer vision. People do not need to wear gloves. As its name implies, this method collects and analyzes information through a computer. It is convenient, comfortable, and not so limited based on external device identification. In contrast, it has greater potential and is more in line with the trend of the times. Of course, this method needs more effective and accurate algorithms to support, because the gestures made by different people at different times, in different environments and at different angles also represent different meanings. So, if we want more accurate information feedback. Then the advancement of algorithms and technology is inevitable. The development of gesture recognition is also the development of artificial intelligence, a process of the development of various algorithms from data gloves to the development of computer vision-based optical technology plays a role in promoting it.

### 3.1 Hand gesture

#### 3.1.1 Hand gesture recognition and big data 
As we did our research and based on our life experiences, hand gesture recognition is a very hot topic and has all the potential to be the next wave. Hand gesture recognition has recently achieved big success in many fields. The advancement and development of hand gesture recognition is also the development of other technology such as the advancement of computer chips, the advancement of algorithms, the advancement of machine learning even advancement of deep learning, and the advancement of cameras from 2D to 3D. The most important part of hand gesture recognition is big data and machine learning. Because of the development of big data and machine learning, data scientists are able to have better datasets, build a more accurate and successful model and be able to process the information and predict the most accurate results. Hand gesture recognition is a significant link in Gesture recognition.However gesture recognition is also not only about hand gesture recognition, it also includes other body parts such as facial expression recognition and body gesture recognition. With the help of the whole system of different gesture recognitions, the data can be recorded and processed by AIs. The results or predictions can be used currently or later on for different purposes in different areas.[^2]

### 3.2 Body Gesture
#### 3.2.1 Introduction to Body Gesture
Body gestures, which can also be called body language, refer to humans expressing their ideas through the coordinated activities of various body parts. In our lives, body language is ubiquitous. It is like a bridge for our human communication. Through body language expression, it is often easier for us to understand what the other person wants to express. At the same time, we can express ourselves better. The profession of an actor is a good example of body language. This is a compulsory course for every actor because actors can only use their performances to let us know what they are expressing.[^4] At this time, body language becomes extremely important. Different characters have different body movements in different situations, and actors need to make the right body language at a specific time to let the audience know their inner feelings. Yes, the most important point of body language is to convey mood through movement.

In many cases, certain actions will make people feel emotions. For us who communicate with all kinds of people every day, there are also many body languages that we are more familiar with. For example, when a person hangs his head, it means that he is unhappy, walking back and forth is a sign of a person's anxiety, and body shaking is caused by nervousness, etc.

### 3.3 Face gesture
#### 3.3.1 Introduction to Face gesture(Facial Expression)
Body language is one of the ways that we can express ourselves without saying any words. According to expert, body language is used everyday for us to communicate with each other. During our communication, we not only use words but also use body gestures, hand gestures and most importantly, we use facial expression most. The reason why we use facial expression more than any other body gestures is that when we have certain emotion, it is express in our face automatically. Facial expression is often not under our control. That is why people often say that the word that come out of mouth cannot always be true, but their facial expression will reveal what those people are thinking about. Some example of common facial expression will be: Happiness, Sadness, Anger, Surprise, Disgust, Fear, etc. [^6] Each facial expression will have some deep meaning behind it. For example, A simple facial expression like smiling can be translated into a sign of approval, or it can be translated into a sign of friendly. If we put all those emotion into big data, it will help us to understand ourselves much better.
