## Abstract

Since our technology is more and more advanced as time goes by, traditional human-computer interaction has become increasingly difficult to meet people's demands. In this digital era, people need faster and more efficient methods to obtain information and data. Traditional and single input and output devices are not fast and convenient enough, it also requires users to learn their own methods of use, which is extremely inefficient and completely a waste of time. Therefore, artificial intelligence comes out, and its rise has followed the changeover times, and it satisfied people's needs. At the same time, gesture is one of the most important way for human to deliver information. It is simple, efficient, convenient, and universally acceptable. Therefore, gesture recognition has become an emerging field in intelligent human-computer interaction field, with great potential and future.

## 1. Introduction

As of today, since technology is improving so fast, there are many things that can be related to AI and machine learning. Hand gestures will be one of the most important ways to understand people. As we often notice, when people are doing speech, they often use hand gestures to collaborate with their words. And studying hand gestures will often reveal what the people who are giving the speech are thinking about. For example, when someone is lying, they tend to touch their nose with their hand, etc. So studying hand gestures will not only help people understand much more about human beings and it can also help our technology grow. For example, in AI and machine learning. Studying hand gestures will make or improve AI and machine learning to better understand humans and be more human-like.

## 2. Background

Nowadays, people are doing more and more research on high-tech, which also makes various high-tech products appear in the society. For people, electricity is as important as water and air. It is impossible to imagine a life without electricity. We can realize that technology is changing everything about people from various aspects. People living in this high-tech era are also forced to learn and understand the usage of various high-tech products. As a representative of high technology, artificial intelligence has also attracted a lot of attention in society. Because of the emergence of artificial intelligence, people have also begun to realize that preserving the characteristics of the people is also a very important point in high technology. Therefore, scientists thought of gestures, one of the most commonly used body language.


## 3. Gesture recognition

Gesture recognition is mainly divided into two categories, one is based on external device recognition, the specific application is data gloves, wearing it on user's hand, to obtain and analysis information through sensors. This method has obvious shortcomings, though it is accurate and has excellent response speed, but it is costly and is not good for large-scale promotion. The other one is the use of computer vision. People do not need to wear gloves. As its name implies, this method collects and analyzes information through a computer. It is convenient, comfortable, and not so limited based on external device identification. In contrast, it has greater potential and is more in line with the trend of the times. Of course, this method needs more effective and accurate algorithms to support, because the gestures made by different people at different times, in different environments and at different angles also represent different meanings. So, if we want more accurate information feedback. Then the advancement of algorithms and technology is inevitable. The development of gesture recognition is also the development of artificial intelligence, a process of the development of various algorithms from data gloves to the development of computer vision-based optical technology plays a role in promoting it.

## 4. Conclusion

## Plan

- Machine learning and especially deep learning has been really hot these years. With the help of technology, our lives are more and convenient and much easier than before. In this way, machine learning and deep learning has been a really hot topic and is undoubtedly our future. Gesture Recognition is also very trendy and has been working on for many years. However, it is not even close to its peak. And because gesture recognition is so useful in all fields, we are thinking about doing projects on this topic. We are going to cover some major features of gesture recognition as our research goes on. In this way, we are going to do lots of research on this area and use the dataset we get from online resources to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of gesture recognition. 


3. Dataset

- We are planning to search and collect some datasets on the website.
- Our current dataset is directly coming from IBM Research and it is a really trustworthy dataset website. We are planning on using this dataset for our gesture recognition project. However, it is possible that we might change our mind as our project goes through. In that case, if the dataset we plan on using right is not working the best with our project, we will find some other related dataset later. 


4. What needs to be done to get a great grade

- We need to unite and cooperate friendly.
- We set up a chatting room for us to chat with each other, therefore if there is any problem that one of us wants to discuss with, we get the chat room to communicate with the team.
- We set up a google drive folder that is shared with the whole team. In this way, we can do the work together and check each other’s works.
- If a team member has any questions or comments on the team or project, he or she should say that out honestly.
- All team members should do some research and share it with everyone.
- We need to set up a specific meeting time every week in order for all the people in our group to not fall behind. 
- We need to check the rubric as we move on and make sure that we meet all the requirements for the project. 
- Go to office hours for the class and check with the AI and professor about our project details to ensure that everything is running smoothly. 
- We can check other team members’ works and correct them if any of us find out the problem with it. In this way, we can also know what we get wrong and how we can make it better.
- We will need to practice the ability to use Github and open resources programs since we don’t have much past experience of it.
- We will follow directions on the rubric about writing project reports with the IEEE format, this is something we haven’t tried before, but we will try our best to make sure we are doing it correctly. 
- Processing data is also a sort of new field for all of us, but we are going to do lots of research, and watching some tutorials online to get the result we want.
